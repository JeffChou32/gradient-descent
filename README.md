# Gradient Descent
This project explores how different hyperparameter combinations affect the performance of neural networks on the Wine Quality (White) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to evaluate models using various activation functions, learning rates, epoch counts, and hidden layer configurations. For each combination, the model is trained, evaluated, and visualized using a training loss curve. Final results are summarized in a performance table to help identify the most effective setup.
